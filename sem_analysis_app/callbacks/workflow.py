"""
Semi-automatic workflow: prepare on load, then save-and-advance.

The loop is: pick an image once, let the app settle its scale and produce ranked
mask candidates unattended, choose the best candidate, correct it with clicks,
then save and move to the next image without going back to the gallery.

Scale is not touched here. The Scale tab establishes it when the image opens and
is the only place that sets it — this module used to re-detect it on every
image, which could silently replace a calibration the analyst had confirmed.
