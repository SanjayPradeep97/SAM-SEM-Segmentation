# Quantification and Classification of Carbon Nanotubes in Electron Micrographs using Vision Foundation Models

Code, results and reproduction scripts for the paper of that title (Pradeep,
Wang, Dahm, Eldredge & Tsai; *Scientific Reports*, under review). This branch
(`publication`) is written for someone who has the paper open and wants to
check a number. Every reported value can be recomputed from the files here;
the expensive ones can also be recomputed from the raw images.

The project does two things:

1. **Segmentation and quantification.** An interactive tool built on Meta's
   Segment Anything Model: read the scale bar (OCR or metadata), click on
   particles to get masks, post-process them, and measure area and equivalent
   diameter. This is the tool used for Table 1 and to produce every mask in the
   classification dataset. [`docs/SEGMENTATION_TOOL.md`](docs/SEGMENTATION_TOOL.md)
   is its manual.
2. **Classification.** A frozen DINOv2 ViT-B/14 whose hypercolumn features are
   pooled only inside the particle's mask, followed by a small MLP, assigns each
   segmented particle to Fiber, Cluster, Matrix or MatrixSurface. The
   evaluation protocol, the eight-encoder benchmark, five fine-tuned baselines,
   the Luo et al. re-implementation and every statistical test are in
   [`classification/`](classification/) and [`baseline/`](baseline/).

A [demo](demo/README.md) joins the two on 60 included micrographs: click on a
particle, SAM masks it, the classifier labels it. `demo/run_demo.bat` (or
`.sh`) is the one-command start.

## Repository layout

| directory | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `sem_particle_analysis/`, `sem_analysis_app/`, `sem_review_app/`, `tests/` | the segmentation library, its Gradio app, the review app for correcting a batch analysis, and their test suite (as on `main`) |
| `classification/` | protocol, feature extraction, probes, fine-tuned baselines, statistics, figure and table scripts, tests |
| `baseline/` | the Luo et al. (2021) VGG-16 + VLAD re-implementation and its results |
| `results/` | the run the paper reports: every configuration's metrics and **per-image predictions**, `analysis.json`, the epoch sweep, regenerated figures |
| `splits/` | `dataset_splits.pkl`, the 1,785-image partition every number uses, plus the same as a CSV |
| `demo/` | the click-to-classify demonstration, with 60 held-out micrographs, their expert masks and the paper's classifier heads |
| `reproduce.bat`, `reproduce.sh` | the one-command reproduction (Windows / Linux-macOS) |

## Install

Two conda environments, one per half of the project.

**Classification pipeline, baseline and demo** (`cnt-vfm`):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml          # NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.8 wheels)
conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml      # no CUDA: macOS, or CPU-only machines
conda activate cnt-vfm
python classification/check_env.py
```

**Segmentation tool** (`SEM_analysis`): see the install section of
[`docs/SEGMENTATION_TOOL.md`](docs/SEGMENTATION_TOOL.md). It needs EasyOCR and
Gradio and is kept separate because EasyOCR pins its own PyTorch.

A minimal environment for the baseline alone is in `baseline/environment.yml`.
The CUDA file pins the `+cu128` PyTorch build so an RTX 50-series card works
(an unpinned `torch` resolves to a CPU-only wheel); the CPU file takes PyTorch
from PyPI. The demo, the statistics, the tables and the tests run on CPU;
re-extracting features and re-running the benchmark want a GPU.

## Data

The TEM images come from the NIOSH collection deposited on Harvard Dataverse,
<https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5O0SF7> (*Dataset of TEM Images for Carbon
Nanomaterial Classification*, 5,323 files, licence CC BY-NC 4.0). The paper
uses 1,785 images; `splits/dataset_splits.csv` lists which, and in which
partition.

**Coverage of the public deposit, stated exactly.** 1,705 of the 1,785 are in
the Dataverse record under the same file names, pixel for pixel (checked on a
sample of 12 across all four classes). The remaining 80 (64 train, 8
validation, 8 test; listed in `splits/not_on_dataverse.csv`) are from the same
NIOSH collection but are not in the current Dataverse version;
`splits/dataverse_files.txt` is the record's file list as retrieved on
2026-09-07. Those 80 images and all 1,785 masks are distributed with the
paper's data archive (see the paper's Code availability statement), so the
benchmark is reproducible from the archive but not from Dataverse alone.
`python classification/check_data.py` reports what a local data root is
missing.

**Sixty of them are included**, with their expert masks, under
[`demo/images/`](demo/images/) and [`demo/masks/`](demo/masks/), so the
segment-then-classify pipeline can be tried without downloading anything else
(see [`demo/ATTRIBUTION.md`](demo/ATTRIBUTION.md) for the licence terms). All
sixty are in the Dataverse record; `demo/fetch_demo_images.py --download
--verify` fetches the originals and confirms the shipped PNGs are identical.
The full dataset is needed only to re-run the benchmark itself.

Set `CNT_BASE` to a directory laid out as

```
<CNT_BASE>/
    NIOSH Dataset/CNT-Fiber/CNT-Fiber-0001.tif ...       the Dataverse download
    NIOSH Dataset/CNT-Cluster/ ...   CNT-Matrix/ ...   CNT-MatrixSurface/ ...
    NIOSH Dataset/Masks/masks/CNT-Fiber-0001_mask.png ... the segmentation masks
```

Feature caches (`Encoder Benchmark/`, about 1.5 GB) and download caches
(`_cache/`) are created underneath it. Nothing in the code refers to any other
location; `classification/cnt_paths.py` is the single place paths are resolved.

**Masks.** The 1,785 masks were made with the segmentation tool in this
repository. The 60 that belong to the demo images are in `demo/masks/`; the
full set is distributed with the paper's data archive rather than in this
branch. Any mask can be regenerated with the tool (`docs/SEGMENTATION_TOOL.md`,
"Interactive refinement") or with the demo, which makes masks live. The
classification pipeline refuses to run if a mask is missing, and says so.

The SEM images of Table 1 were acquired under a collaboration that does not
permit redistribution.

## The one-command reproduction

```bat
conda activate cnt-vfm
set CNT_BASE=<data root>
reproduce.bat
```

What it does, and how long it takes on an RTX 5080:

| step | what | time |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | environment check; assert `encoder_bench.py` and `paper_results.py` agree on every feature-cache name | 20 s |
| 1–2 | extract features for 8 encoders (benchmark geometry) and DINOv2 (manuscript geometry) | ~10 min first time, seconds afterwards |
| 3 | 108 frozen probes, 10 fine-tuned baselines, statistics | ~3 h; **skipped while `results/analysis.json` exists** (`--force` recomputes) |
| 4 | epoch-budget sweep | 3 min |
| 5 | Figures 4, 7, 8 into `results/figures/` | 2 min |
| 6 | LaTeX bodies of Tables 2 and 3, printed | 1 s |
| 7 | `verify_manuscript.py`: every headline number re-derived and checked | 1 s |

Because `results/` ships with the run the paper reports, a first run finishes in
the time feature extraction takes, and step 7 passes against the shipped
files. Delete or `--force` to recompute from the images. Details, including
how to run stage 3 in pieces, are in
[`classification/REPRODUCE.md`](classification/REPRODUCE.md). The Luo
baseline is its own command (`baseline/run_all.py`, about 2 h).

Without a GPU or the images, the statistics still recompute from the shipped
per-image predictions:

```bash
python classification/paper_results.py --stages analyse     # rewrites results/analysis.json
python classification/make_tables.py
python classification/verify_manuscript.py
```

## Where each number, figure and table comes from

| in the paper | produced by | from |
|---|---|---|
| Table 1 (segmentation Dice/IoU, clicks) | the segmentation tool, `sem_particle_analysis/`, on the validation images of the original submission; not regenerated by `reproduce.bat` (the SEM images cannot be redistributed) | |
| Table 2 (selected configurations) | `classification/make_tables.py` | `results/results_probes.csv` |
| Table 3 (baselines and *p* values) | `classification/make_tables.py` | `results/results_probes.csv`, `results/results_finetune.csv`, `results/analysis.json`, `baseline/results/luo_results_*.json` |
| Figs. 1, 2, 3, 5 (image mosaics, architecture diagram, misclassified examples) | figures from the original submission, assembled by hand or with notebooks that are not part of this branch | |
| Fig. 4 (test confusion matrix) | `classification/figures/make_confusion.py` | `results/per_image_probe.json` |
| Fig. 6 (DINOv2 activation mosaic) | figure from the original submission, produced with notebooks that are not part of this branch; unchanged in revision | |
| Fig. 7 (SAM activation mosaic) and the 1.05 / 0.97 ratios in its caption | `classification/figures/make_sam_mosaic.py`, `neck_inversion.py` | four micrographs + masks, SAM ViT-B checkpoint |
| Fig. 8 (t-SNE of the test set) | `classification/figures/make_tsne.py` | DINOv2 manuscript-geometry feature cache |
| Fig. 9 (composite multi-particle demo) | figure from the original submission, produced with the segmentation tool and notebooks that are not part of this branch | |
| headline 89.5 % ± 1.0 % CV, 92.7 % (166/179) test, CI 88.0–95.7 % | `classification/paper_results.py --stages analyse` | `results/analysis.json` → `headline` |
| "108 configurations, 80.8 % to 89.7 %, mean 86.6 % ± 2.0 %" | `verify_manuscript.py` derives them | `results/results_probes.csv` |
| mask effect: 54/54 pairs, +2.48 pp, sign test, *t* = 17.8 | `classification/analyse.py::mask_effect` | `results/analysis.json` → `mask_effect` |
| every *p* value (exact McNemar, Holm over 117 tests) | `classification/analyse.py::compare_all` | `results/analysis.json` → `comparisons` |
| fine-tuned baselines and the 4.3–9.0 pp margin | `paper_results.py --stages finetune` | `results/results_finetune.csv`, `results/per_image_finetune.json` |
| Luo et al. row | `baseline/run_all.py`, selected by `classification/luo_results.py` | `baseline/results/` |
| Supplementary S2 (layer ablation), S3 (MLP sweep), S5 (CLS token) | notebooks from the original submission, not part of this branch and not re-run in revision | |
| Supplementary Table S3 (all 108 configurations) | `results/results_probes.csv` directly | |
| epoch-budget check | `classification/epoch_sweep.py` | `results/epoch_sweep.json` |

`classification/verify_manuscript.py` prints every derived value in the form the
paper prints it; run it and compare.

## What the protocol guarantees

`classification/paper_protocol.py` is the single evaluation routine every method
goes through: frozen probes, fine-tuned networks and the VLAD baseline alike.

* **The test set is scored once, for a configuration fixed in advance.**
  `PRIMARY` is declared as a literal before any result exists (DINOv2, 518 px,
  taps [1,3,6,9,11], mask-guided avg+max pooling, MLP). No table can promote
  another configuration on the strength of a test number; other rows in
  Table 3 show each method's best configuration *by cross-validated accuracy*.
* **Early stopping uses an inner split only.** Each fold model trains on 90 %
  of its training folds and stops on the remaining 10 %; the held-out fold and
  the test set are never a stopping monitor. `_guarded()` enforces this on
  every call; `test_protocol.py` and `mutants.py` re-inject seven bugs,
  including the one in the paragraph below, and show each is caught.
* **Scalers are fit on training rows only.**
* **Caches are keyed by split** (and by geometry, pyramid input size, a
  random-weights flag and any checkpoint override), so features of one split
  can never be loaded for another; `check_cache_agreement.py` proves both
  scripts build the same names.
* **Comparisons are made on 1,606 out-of-fold predictions**, not on the
  179-image test set, which cannot resolve differences of a few points; the
  test set is reported once with a Wilson interval.

## What changed, and the earlier number

An earlier version of this work reported 95.53 % test accuracy. That figure was
produced by a notebook that passed the test loader into the validation slot of
the training loop, so the final checkpoint was selected on the test set. The
error was found during revision, the protocol above was written so it cannot
recur, and every number in the paper comes from that protocol. The details,
including the +4.7 pp signature the bug left across all 24 original
configurations, are in `classification/paper_protocol.py` and
`classification/REPRODUCE.md`. `verify_manuscript.py` exists so the manuscript
and the results files cannot drift apart again.

Two further things a careful reader will find, stated here rather than left to
be discovered:

* **The `refit_unreliable` column.** Each row carries three test-set variants;
  the paper reports the fold ensemble. The single-model "refit" variant is
  meaningless for four fine-tuned rows whose folds stopped inside the first
  three epochs, and is flagged as such (`classification/REPRODUCE.md`, "The
  `refit_unreliable` flag").
* **The Luo baseline's descriptor normalisation** is not specified in the
  original paper. All three options the re-implementation offers were run
  under the clean protocol (cross-validated accuracy: `none` 85.49 %, `l2`
  84.62 %, `blockl2` 84.31 %; held-out test 87.71 %, 87.71 % and 87.15 %),
  and the best on cross-validation, `none`, is the row the paper reports
  (`baseline/README.md`, `classification/luo_results.py`). Repeated runs of
  this baseline move by up to half a point on CV; the ordering did not change.

Development scratch is not included: superseded runs on a different, balanced
1,800-image split, an abandoned relabelling exercise, working directories and
feature caches. What is here is the run the paper reports and everything
needed to recompute it.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -m "not slow"                        # segmentation library and apps, under a minute, in the cnt-vfm env
pytest                                       # + the tests that need SAM weights and EasyOCR (segmentation-tool env)
cd classification
python test_protocol.py                      # 42 checks on the protocol (needs one feature cache)
python mutants.py                            # re-injects 7 audited bugs; all must be caught
python test_yolo_adapter.py                  # no GPU or images needed
python test_cache.py
python check_data.py                         # is every image and mask of the split present under CNT_BASE?
```

The demo has its own checks: `demo/train_demo_head.py` refuses to write heads
whose test predictions differ from the shipped per-image predictions, and
`demo/fetch_demo_images.py --download --verify` confirms the shipped PNGs are
pixel-identical to the Dataverse originals.
