"""
finetune_fit.py -- the end-to-end fine-tuning adapter for paper_protocol.run().

The frozen probes and the fine-tuned CNNs go through the SAME protocol object,
so the comparison the reviewers asked for is like-for-like: same 1,606
development images, same five folds, same held-out 179, same rule for when the
test set may be touched.  Only the model differs.

`convnextv2` was listed in the plan but is not a key in finetune_baselines.MODELS;
it is added here rather than silently dropped.
