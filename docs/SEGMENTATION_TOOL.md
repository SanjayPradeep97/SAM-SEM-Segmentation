# The segmentation tool

Segmentation and measurement of particles in electron micrographs, built on
Meta's Segment Anything Model. There are two ways in: a Gradio application for
working through images one at a time, and `sem-analyze` for running a folder
headless. Both sit on the `sem_particle_analysis` library, which can also be
imported directly.

This is the tool that produced Table 1 of the paper and every mask in the
classification dataset.

## Install

```bash
conda create -n SEM_analysis python=3.11
conda activate SEM_analysis
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install -e .
```

The PyTorch line is the one that varies. Use the `cu128` index for an NVIDIA
card, `conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch` on Apple Silicon, and add
`cpuonly` for a machine without a GPU. The environment is kept separate from the
classification half because EasyOCR pins its own PyTorch.

Then fetch a SAM checkpoint into `sam_weights/`:

```bash
python download_sam_weights.py --model vit_h
```

`vit_h` is 2.4 GB and is what the paper used; `vit_b` is 358 MB and faster. With
no `--model` the script asks. A GPU segments an image in one to three seconds, a
CPU in ten to thirty.

## Run the application

```bash
python -m sem_analysis_app       # from the repository root
run_app.bat                      # Windows, activates the conda env first
```

It serves `http://127.0.0.1:7860`. `--port` and `--host` change where it
listens. The app keeps a single process-wide state object, so it is built for
one analyst at a time; two browser tabs pointed at the same server share one
session.

Module layout:

```
sem_analysis_app/
    __main__.py       entry point (python -m sem_analysis_app)
    ui.py             tab layout and event wiring
    state.py          shared application state
    static/           the scale box and magnifier, client-side
    callbacks/        event handlers, one module per tab
    visualization.py  overlays and figures
```

`sem_review_app/` is a second, smaller page for correcting the output of a batch
run; it reuses the same callbacks.

## Establishing scale

Scale gets its own tab, because every measurement is a pixel count multiplied by
this one number. Three tiers, tried in order of trustworthiness:

| Tier | Method | When it applies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Pixel size read from the file's own metadata | Automatic on load. Exact, nothing to check |
| 2 | Read the printed scale bar inside a box you draw | Runs automatically first; drag the box if it got it wrong |
| 3 | Click both ends of the bar and type its length | When the bar is unreadable. A magnifier follows the cursor so you land on the exact pixel |

Tier 2's box is manipulated directly on the image: drag anywhere to draw one,
drag a corner to resize, drag the middle to move. Tier 3 shows a 7x loupe with a
crosshair marking precisely which pixel a click will land on.

A tier-2 reading is marked unconfirmed until you press **Confirm scale**; tier 1
and tier 3 are trusted outright, since neither involves a machine reading a
glyph. The result is shown as "X nm/px · how it was obtained", and it is what the
Processing tab and the results CSV use. Nothing downstream re-detects scale or
overrides what you set here.

Calibration needs only OCR, so you can sort out scale before loading a SAM
checkpoint.

## SEM and TEM in one workflow

The two need opposite handling, and the app works out which it is looking at from
the file rather than asking you to remember:

| | SEM | TEM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instrument read from | FEI / Zeiss / Hitachi / TESCAN tags | JEOL mode tag, else frame shape |
| Databar | detected and trimmed | none, frame kept whole |
| Scale bar | in the databar, which gets cropped | burned into the frame, so its patch is excluded from measurement |
| Particles are | **brighter** than the substrate | **darker** than the support film |

Both decisions are shown on the Scale tab and can be overridden there, or with
`--modality` and `--particles` in batch mode.

**Analysable region.** Micrographs routinely contain large areas that are not
specimen: the black corners left by a circular aperture, a specimen grid bar
blocking the beam, a burned-in scale bar. Every one of them out-contrasts the
particles, so they are excluded before anything is measured. Left in, they are
what gets measured. On real frames these produced five "particles" of 119 µm
that were the corner wedges, and 221 spurious particles that were a grid bar.
The share excluded is shown on the Scale tab and recorded per image in
`run.json`.

**Magnification.** Low-magnification overviews are navigation frames; their
particles are a few pixels across and counting them adds noise.
`--max-nm-per-px` skips them, and skipped frames are recorded as skipped rather
than failed.

## Batch analysis without the GUI

For a dataset you intend to publish, run the pipeline headless. Every run writes
a `run.json` recording the image hashes, model and checkpoint hash, the scale and
how it was obtained, all parameters, library versions and the git revision, so a
result can be traced back to exactly what produced it.

```bash
sem-analyze path/to/images -o path/to/output --clear-edges
```

Outputs: `particles.csv` (one row per particle), `per_image_summary.csv`,
`size_distribution.png/.pdf` at 300 dpi, and `run.json`. Input may be `.tif`,
`.tiff`, `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`; prefer original TIFFs, because the scale
detector can read pixel size straight from vendor metadata, which is exact.

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--scale-nm-per-px X` | Fix the scale instead of detecting it per image |
| `--scale-method metadata\|ocr\|auto` | How to establish scale (default `auto`) |
| `--clear-edges` | Drop particles touching the frame; they are only partly imaged |
| `--min-size N` | Ignore particles below N pixels (default 30) |
| `--crop-percent P` | Override databar removal (default: measure it) |
| `--model-type vit_b` | Faster, lower quality than the default `vit_h` |
| `--modality SEM\|TEM` | Force the instrument kind (default: read it from the file) |
| `--particles bright\|dark` | Force particle polarity (default: follow the modality) |
| `--max-nm-per-px X` | Skip frames coarser than this, magnifications too low to resolve particles |
| `--min-nm-per-px X` | Skip frames finer than this |

Batch mode uses the automatic pipeline only, with no interactive refinement, and
picks its mask candidate by heuristic. The chosen mask and the rejected
candidates are recorded in `run.json`.

## Use as a library

```python
from sem_particle_analysis import SAMModel, ScaleDetector, ParticleSegmenter, ParticleAnalyzer
from sem_particle_analysis.utils import load_image

image = load_image("micrograph.tif")
scale = ScaleDetector().detect_scale_bar(image)          # nm per pixel

segmenter = ParticleSegmenter(SAMModel("sam_weights/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth", model_type="vit_h"))
segmenter.segment_image(image)
segmenter.select_mask()                                   # highest-scoring candidate

analyzer = ParticleAnalyzer(conversion_factor=scale["conversion"])
n, regions = analyzer.analyze_mask(segmenter.get_binary_mask(invert=True))
print(n, analyzer.get_measurements(in_nm=True))
```

`ParticleAnalyzer` also offers `clear_edge_particles`, `delete_particles` and
`merge_particles` for correcting a mask, and `ParticleSegmenter.refine_with_sam`
takes point prompts. `ResultsManager` accumulates per-image measurements and
writes the CSV.

## Optional dependencies

Only two parts of the toolkit need the heavy optional stack:

| Dependency | Needed for | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `easyocr` | Reading a printed scale bar (tier 2) | Scale from metadata or by hand still works; OCR raises `OCRUnavailableError` explaining the fix |
| `gradio` | The web app | The library and `sem-analyze` are unaffected |

Importing `sem_particle_analysis` pulls in neither. EasyOCR's models load on
first OCR use rather than when a `ScaleDetector` is constructed, so a
metadata-only run never pays for them.

## Tests

```bash
pytest                      # everything
pytest -m "not slow"        # skip tests needing model weights or OCR
```

The fast suite takes under a minute and needs neither SAM weights nor EasyOCR;
tests that do are marked `slow` and skip themselves with a reason when their
dependency is missing. Measurements are checked against shapes of exactly known
size. `tests/synthetic.py` builds micrographs whose scale bar length, printed
label and particle mask are all ground truth, so a regression shows up as a
wrong number rather than merely a changed one.
