    Make sure pytest has somewhere writable to put ``tmp_path`` directories.

    pytest creates per-run temp directories under ``<TEMP>/pytest-of-<user>``. On
    Windows that directory is sometimes left behind by a run under a different or
    elevated identity, with ACLs the current user cannot read, rename or delete
    without elevation. Every test taking ``tmp_path`` then errors at setup with
    ``PermissionError: [WinError 5]``, and no amount of cleaning the working tree
    helps.

    Rather than require a manual, elevated fix before the suite can run at all,
    probe the default root and redirect to a fresh one if it is unusable.
    ``PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT`` names the *parent*; pytest creates its own
    ``pytest-of-<user>`` inside it.

    Runs at conftest import, which is before the temp factory first resolves a
    path. An explicit ``PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT`` is always left alone.
