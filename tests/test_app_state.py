"""
Application state: the undo history that makes editing recoverable.

Applying an edit used to be a point of no return — the click-level undo stack
was cleared on Apply, and nothing recorded the mask beforehand. Since the
analyst applies constantly to see the result, one wrong Apply meant
re-segmenting the image from scratch, part way through a folder of hundreds.

Imports the state module directly rather than through the app, so this runs
without Gradio.
